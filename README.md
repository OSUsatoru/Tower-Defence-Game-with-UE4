## Project Description:
Our project, codenamed TD Squared (TD2), is a game that combines the action moments of a top down shooter with the strategic planning of a tower defense. Built in Unreal Engine 4, the game uses some unique characteristics of both genres which combine and complement each other, creating an entirely new experience. Before a wave begins, you as the player can choose from a randomly generated set of towers with abilities ranging from destroying enemies to spawning friendly units, and place these defenses into the world. Once a wave begins your role switches from strategic planning to actively fighting the oncoming hordes of enemies. Equipped with a set of customizable abilities, you can engage with incoming enemies directly or assist your units and towers from the sidelines. Similar to a traditional tower defense, your goal is to outlast the ever growing waves, but with one additional consideration. If youâ€™re able to muster an army large enough to push into the enemy base, you can destroy it and prevent the largest and most threatening reinforcements from arriving on your doorstep.
